/*
Consider a highway of M miles. The task is to place billboards on the highway such that revenue is maximized.
The possible sites for billboards are given by number x1 < x2 < â€¦.. < xn-1 < xn, specifying positions in

	miles measured from one end of the road. If we place a billboard at position xi, we receive a revenue of ri > 0.
	 There is a restriction that no two billboards can be placed within t miles or less than it.

Note : All possible sites from x1 to xn are in range from 0 to M as need to place billboards on a highway of M miles.
Examples:

Input : M = 20

	x[]       = {6, 7, 12, 13, 14}
	revenue[] = {5, 6, 5,  3,  1}
	t = 5

Output: 10
By placing two billboards at 6 miles and 12
miles will produce the maximum revenue of 10.

Input : M = 15

	x[] = {6, 9, 12, 14}
	revenue[] = {5, 6, 3, 7}
	t = 2

Output : 18
